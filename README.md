#Note
I am having an issue with this project if you notice when you post a tweet or like or comment to a tweet there is a delay between the database and the clent-side and the it is not like that locally when building I really don't know what the issue is and my database is SANITY and there is no delay when u send to database but the is a delay when I want to fetch from the database.

I would really appreciate if you can be of help.
